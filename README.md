NOTE: In order to connect to test and developement databases, you will need to create two .env files in the root directory of this repo.

Each file should contain only the following line:

PGDATABASE=<database_name>

Where <database_name> is the name of the database you wish to use and should already be known to you. IN YOUR FACE, villains!
